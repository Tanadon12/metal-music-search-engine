It's too late for some. \n\nFar too late. \n\nNo more holdbacks. No more paying a cops paycheck. Let him \n\nBust his own child. The son that heeds my word and smokes my dope. \n\nThe daughter that sucks me off and snorts cheap anything. \n\nHail Kings. The new Kings. Stronger than all. \n\nA simple process to legalize. There would not be a choice but to \n\nTake our side. Be there no question of certain strengths. Know \n\nThis intention. Forever stronger than all"}
